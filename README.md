# stratipy
Patients stratification with Graph-regularized Non-negative Matrix Factorization (GNMF) in Python.

## Dependencies
The minimum required dependencies to run the software are:
  - Python >= 3.4
  - NumPy >= 1.6
  - SciPy >= 0.7.2
  - matplotlib >= 0.98.4
  - scikit-learn >= 0.19
  - pandas >= 0.1

## Reproducibility
To reproduce the figure 3 of our paper about reproducibility in bioinformatics, you have two options:
1. Follow the Jupyter Notebook [reproducibility.ipynb](reproducibility/reproducibility.ipynb)
2. Build & run the [Docker](http://docker.com) container with:
```
~$ mkdir <your_output_folder>
~$ docker build -t repro .
~$ docker run -v /absolute/path/of/<your_output_folder>:/reproducibility/reproducibility_output repro
```
**For Windows or Mac users:** total runtime memory of Docker is fixed to 2 GB by default. In order to launch this project, you have to increase this limit (approximately 7 GB):
- [Windows setting](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#advanced)
- [Mac setting](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#cpus)
